webtest
=======

webtest is a package for web application testing both on HTTP (rest)
and on the application level in the browser.  It makes use of the HTTP
package, the webdriver* package family and Selenium for browser remote
control, and quickcheck for test case generation and shrinking.  It
provides abstract machines that represent states and transitions of an
application.

The structure of the package may change in the future, and things may
be moved into other packages and re-imported here if it makes more
sense.  Suggestions are always welcome!
